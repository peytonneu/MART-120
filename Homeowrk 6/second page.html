        "Will the moon ever rise again?" The streets below were drowned out to silence, just the two of them. "I dream of it sometimes. Through the dawn hour, dreaming of a night where the moon returns to us in some way. 
        To gaze up at the stars that surround it..Maybe that they could tell our story.." The man behind her huffed. His fingers swimming through her locks, braiding the soft strands. 
        "You're dreaming of stars again, that's what you dream about every night" "I know I know. But, it's better than nothing. is it not? We have so much we lost and one of them being the stars. Is it too much to dream of something you miss?"
        "hm.." he continued his work, the sound of the city below coming back to his ears, the sound of the people, the children, animals, all of what he sees everyday. He stopped, finishing his work on her braid.
        "Amalia..." "Yes Mydeimos?" The way she looked back at him, the way her eyes sparkled, shined, like the stars she dreamed about "...Keep on dreaming"
