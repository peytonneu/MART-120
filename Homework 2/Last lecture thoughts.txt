At the beginning of the video, after he spoke in his native tongue I wasn’t fully understanding what he was explaining. That includes the rest of the video, I couldn’t seem to pin point what he was talking about and I think that’s where my understanding of the video comes in, I could not relate nor understand what he was explaining because I myself could not relate to all he was explaining when it came to his cultural experiences. But after listening to it a few more times and having help understanding, what effected me most is realizing how different it can be growing up in education. As I grew up if I wasn’t doing good in something I was either pulled out or dropped into the same class but different teachers, hoping to see change. I may not understand on a personal level when it comes how different other’s cultures are in education but I do see it and when I hear about it, it makes me think about how different other people grow up. I’m learning everyday on how other cultures work. In a personal and educational sense.
