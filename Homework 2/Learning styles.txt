Learning styles are extremely important when it comes to how we learn and how we can help others! I work best visually and auditory, when it comes to reading it can be extremely hard for me to stay focused, understand or not get too frustrated if I have to reread it multiple times or don't understand. Having stuff read to me helps me so much, even reading it after I listen can help too. I think all learning styles can be helpful separate and together, depends on how the person prefers it. From my experiences, learning styles affect how I learn and some can be negative and helpful depending on what style I use. When helping others I like to ask how they prefer to learn so it's easy for them and easy for me to explain, show or let them read.
